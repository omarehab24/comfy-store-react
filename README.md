## Routing

The application uses React Router v6 with a nested routing structure:

- `/` - Landing page with featured products
- `/products` - Product catalog
- `/products/:id` - Individual product details
- `/cart` - Shopping cart
- `/checkout` - Checkout process
- `/orders` - Order history
- `/login` - User login
- `/register` - User registration

## State Management

- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages global application state (user authentication, cart)
- **React Query**: Handles server state with built-in caching (products, orders)
  - Configured with a 5-minute stale time for optimal performance

## Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling:

- Custom utility class `.align-element` for consistent maximum width and padding
- Two theme options: Winter (light) and Dracula (dark)
- Responsive design patterns throughout the application

## Development Tools

- React Query DevTools (available in development mode)
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Vite for fast development and optimal builds

## Error Handling

- Route-specific error elements using `ErrorElement` component
- Toast notifications for user feedback
